1. Check for inconsistent data formats and categorizations.
2. Validate dates, numeric values, text formats, and categories are standardized.
3. Identify and fix null or missing values.
4. Detect and remove duplicate records.
5. Create a unified format for "order data" to ensure consistency and avoid confusion.
6. Consolidate different related columns into a single unified Order table with DAX funstions to enhance analysis efficiency.
7. Design clearer, descriptive column names and formats so the data is easily understandable by readers or analysts.

## Summary of Insights
1. The United States is the largest market, followed by Ireland and the United Kingdom.
2. Customers without loyalty cards spend more on average compared to those with loyalty cards.
3. Robusta coffee in the 0.5 kg package size shows weak sales performance.
4. Dark roast coffee performs poorly in the United States.
5. Overall, larger package sizes consistently demonstrate stronger sales across all three markets.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
1. Ireland Market Research – Conduct deeper market research in Ireland to identify growth opportunities and improve profitability.
2. Loyalty Program Enhancement – Collaborate with the marketing team to redesign the loyalty card program, making it more attractive to high-value customers who haven't join this program and increasing participation.
3. Product Mix Adjustment (Robusta 0.5 kg) – Because its underperformance I recommend that the procurement team reduce inventory levels of the 0.5 kg Robusta package.
4. Dark Roast Strategy in the U.S. – The weaker demand might due to cultural or consumption habits, so I recommend to reduce stock levels of dark roast coffee in the United States.
5. Larger Package Advantage – Since larger sizes drive better sales, recommend any marketing plan:
-Price advantage per unit (value for money).
-Environmental benefits (reduced packaging waste).
-Subscription services (convenient delivery of bulk coffee to customers).
